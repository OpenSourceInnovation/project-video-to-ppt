# 3D printing accelerates innovation in the United States.
3D printing accelerates innovation in the United States. Manufacturing in America used to be dirty, messy and messy. 3D printing is layer by layer, lap by lap, going around, building the structure. It's a simple logical process but represents a revolution far beyond the wildest dreams of 18th century man.

# Additive manufacturing will touch the life cycle of nearly every product that's designed and made.
Additive manufacturing will touch the life cycle of nearly every product that's designed and made. It's the growth in the materials, the hardware, the software and the readiness of industry to push forward the applications that puts the industry in a position to grow big. He will come back to MIT to look more closely at the relationship between manufacturing jobs and innovation.

# Making a product is not going to become more local even if it's made digitally.
If you want to have innovation in the United States, you need to have manufacturing in the U.S. Digital manufacturing accelerates innovation. Not everything is going to be 3D printed and not all manufacturing is going be more local. Even making a product is not going to become more local even if it's made digitally.
